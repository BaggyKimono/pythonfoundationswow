"""_________________Data Structures ___________________________"""

"""

It is very common to want to list numbers or strings. This is possible with data structures. 
Data structures are a specialized format for organizing and storing data. 
There are quite a few data structures that are available that will be described in the following sections.

"""_________________Lists___________________________"""

"""
A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. 
Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as 
characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].

Lists are great to use when you want to work with many related values. 
They allow you to keep data together that belongs together, condense your code, 
and perform the same methods and operations on multiple values at once."""

#Example: Creating a list of strings called dogs
