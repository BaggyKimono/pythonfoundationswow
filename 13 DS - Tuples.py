"""_________________Data Structures ___________________________"""

"""

It is very common to want to list numbers or strings. This is possible with data structures. 
Data structures are a specialized format for organizing and storing data. 
There are quite a few data structures that are available that will be described in the following sections.

"""

"""_________________Tuples___________________________"""

"""
A tuple is a data structure in Python that is an immutable, or unchangeable, ordered sequence of elements. 
Because it is immutable, the elements in the tuple cannot be changed. 
The immutability of a tuple helps send the message to others that the information inside of the tuple should not change.

Each element or value that is inside of a tuple is called an item. 
Just as lists are defined as items between square brackets, tuples are 
defined by having values between parenthesis ( ) and separated by commas. Empty tuples look like: grade_level = (), 
but even tuples with just one item must use commas as in grade_level = (9, )
